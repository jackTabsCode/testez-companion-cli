This is a quick and dirty CLI to interface with [TestEZ Companion](https://github.com/tacheometry/testez-companion). It was made to allow users to run tests from the command line without needing to use the VSCode extension.

You'll need the plugin for this to work.

## Features

-   Easily run tests from the command line
